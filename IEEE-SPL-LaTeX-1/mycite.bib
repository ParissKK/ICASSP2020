	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {In a number of astrophysical applications one tries to determine the two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure of an object from a time series of measurements. While most methods used for reconstruction assume that the object is static, the data are often acquired over a time interval during which the object may change significantly. This problem can be addressed with time-dependent reconstruction methods such as Kalman filtering, which models the temporal evolution of the unknown object as a random walk that may or may not have a deterministic component. Time-dependent reconstructions of a hydrodynamic simulation from its line-integral projections are presented. In these examples standard reconstructions based on the static assumption are poor, while good quality reconstructions are obtained from a regularized Kalman estimate. Implications for various astrophysical applications, including tomography of the solar corona and radio aperture synthesis, are discussed.}

	Abstract = {State-space models as an important mathematical tool has been widely used in many different fields. This edited collection explores recent theoretical developments of the models and their applications in economics and finance. The book includes nonlinear andnon-Gaussian time series models, regime-switching and hidden Markov models, continuous- or discrete-time state processes, and models of equally-spaced or irregularly-spaced (discrete or continuous) observations. The contributed chapters are divided into four parts. The first part is on Particle Filtering and Parameter Learning in Nonlinear State-Space Models. The second part focuseson the application of Linear State-Space Models in Macroeconomics and Finance. The third part deals with Hidden Markov Models, Regime Switching and Mathematical Finance and the fourth part is on Nonlinear State-Space Models for High Frequency Financial Data. The book will appeal to graduate students and researchers studying state-space modeling in economics, statistics, and mathematics, as well as to finance professionals.},

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}",

abstract = {In treating dynamic systems, sequential Monte Carlo methods use discrete samples to represent a complicated probability distribution and use rejection sampling, importance sampling and weighted resampling to complete the on-line âfilteringâ task. We propose a special sequential Monte Carlo method, the mixture Kalman filter, which uses a random mixture of the Gaussian distributions to approximate a target distribution. It is designed for on-line estimation and prediction of conditional and partial conditional dynamic linear models, which are themselves a class of widely used non-linear systems and also serve to approximate many others. Compared with a few available filtering methods including Monte Carlo methods, the gain in efficiency that is provided by the mixture Kalman filter can be very substantial. Another contribution of the paper is the formulation of many non-linear systems into conditional or partial conditional linear form, to which the mixture Kalman filter can be applied. Examples in target tracking and digital communications are given to demonstrate the procedures proposed.},

abstract="Many physical and engineered systems (e.g., smart grid, autonomous vehicles, and robotic systems) that are observed and controlled over a communication/cyber infrastructure can be efficiently modeled as stochastic hybrid systems (SHS). This paper quantifies the bias of a mode-based Kalman filter commonly used for state estimation in SHS. The main approach involves modeling the bias dynamics as a transformed switched system and the transitions across modes are abstracted via arbitrary switching signals. This general model effectively captures a wide range of SHS systems where the modes may follow deterministic, Markovian, or guard condition based transitions. By leveraging techniques developed to analyze the stability of switched systems, we derive conditions for statistical convergence of the bias in a mode-based Kalman filter in the presence of mode mismatch errors. Developed upon the foundations of Lyapunov theory, we demonstrate a linear matrix inequality condition that guarantees asymptotic stability of the corresponding autonomous switched system irrespective of the choice of mode mismatch probability. Furthermore, we obtain the range of mode mismatch probabilities that assures bounded input bounded output stability of the bias dynamics for both stable and unstable SHS. Using numerical simulations of a smart grid with network topology errors, we verify and validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the potency of using the analysis in critical infrastructures.",
